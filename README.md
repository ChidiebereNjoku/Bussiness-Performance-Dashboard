# Business Performance Dashboard
## Description
This project aims to create a comprehensive business performance dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will include key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, gross sales, profit, and discount bands. Users will be able to filter data using slicers for products, segments, countries, and specific time periods (2013 and 2014). The dashboard will feature line graphs for sales by month, bar charts for sales by country, and highlight the top 3 products in each segment by unit sales.
